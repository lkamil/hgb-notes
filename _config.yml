# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Collection of notes I wrote during hgb classes. 
  No mentioning of student names or citation of what someone said during class.
  This is mainly for my personal use. 
  But feel free to use this if you want to look something up or missed class.
baseurl: "/hgb-notes" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "https://lkamil.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
