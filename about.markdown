Collection of notes I wrote during hgb classes. Mainly for personal use and mostly in german (needless to say I am only attending certain courses, so this is not a complete list). But feel free to use this if you want to look something up or missed class.
btw, I study Medienkunst im Grundstudium.

I am not mentioning any student names or cite what someone said during class.

If you have suggestions or privacy concerns, write me an email.
